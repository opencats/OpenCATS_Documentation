**OpenCATS installation**



Go to localhost/OpenCATS-opencats-0.9.3/ 

(Or use the address of your server or VPS in place of "localhost")

Click: ``Installation Wizard``

**Step 1 System Connectivity**
This step makes sure you have the required server environment set up correctly.  

.. note:: Green = good.  
.. note:: Yellow = OpenCATS will work, but some functions may not.  
.. warning:: Red = Bad  You can't continue the installation until a server environment issue is fixed.

(I am setting up this example instance of OpenCATS in a shared hosting service.  I do not have command line access and can not install the required modules to get rid of the yellow areas.  If you are running OpenCATS locally on your computer, or you have root access to a server, VPS, etc., you can install these extra modules and should see all green before continuing.)

I you see all green and/or yellow, click ``Next``

**Step 2 Database connectivity**

Enter your CATS SQL database name, SQL database username, SQL database password, and SQL database host address in these boxes. 
 
*If you are running OpenCATS locally on your computer, or on some shared hosts, the host address will be localhost.  If your server, VPS (some shared hosting too), you will need to enter the specific address to access.

Click ``Test Database Connectivity``

If the SQL information is set up and entered correctly, you should have all green.  If you see red, something needs to be corrected or set up correctly.

**Step 3 Loading Data**


For a new installation, select ``New Installation``, then ``next``

.. note:: Demonstration Installation will autopopulate OpenCATS with general example clients, candidates, job orders, etc.  There's no reason to use this in my opinion.

.. note:: Restore installation from backup will be covered in a future tutorial

**Step 4 Setup resume indexing**

.. note:: This is only is you have root/administrative access, or are in a REALLY flexible shared hosting environment.  Most major shared hosting companies will not install this software for you.  So if you do not have root/administrative access, just skip this step.

.. note:: If you are running on a local machine, on a self-hosted server, VPS, or on a web host that will install packages for you, you can use this functionality.  

Install the software packages listed (You will have to track them down on the internet, I will add links later).  

Click ``Test configuration`` or ``skip this step``.  If it's all green, proceed.

**Step 5 Mail Settings**

OpenCATS can send emails.  If you don't want to use it, you don't have to.  OpenCATS works great either way!  

Choose an option from the Mail Support drop-down bar, fill the necessary information in (if you are using it) and click ``Next``

**Step 6 Loading extras**

Don't forget to set the time zone to your area!

.. warning:: If you forget to set the time zone ALL of the timestamps on every note in OpenCATS will be wrong.  Set the time zone correctly.  You will thank us...

Choose the date format you like best

(United States only) choose to install (if you want) zip code lookup

Click ``next``

**Step 7 Finishing installation**

Runs through the installation process.  You should see a box and some pretty bars moving.  It shouldn't take long.

.. note:: The default username and password are: admin/admin (all lowercase)

Click ``Start OpenCATS`` for your login screen.
